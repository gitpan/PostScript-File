PostScript::File version 1.05, released October 29, 2009

This module produces the outline for an Adobe PostScript file. It provides
convenient routines for writing postscript directly, including reporting
postscript errors and debugging support.  Although it may be used independently,
the functions provided are also suitable for use in other modules.  See one of
these modules for a top-level object.

    PostScript::Calendar
    PostScript::Report
    PostScript::Graph::XY
    PostScript::Graph::Bar
    Finance::Shares::Chart

It is considered beta code as the interface has remained stable over many months
of use.  However, not all the features have been tested properly so experiment
with caution.



INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install



DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries, although they are both

CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 1.05 of PostScript::File:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	- Major change in the way reencode works
	  Setting it to 'cp1252' or 'iso-8859-1' causes automatic
	  character set translation from Unicode strings.
	- Added cp1252 (Win1252Encoding) support
	  Most people should now use reencode => 'cp1252',
	  even if they are not on Windows, to get the best
	  Unicode support (which is still quite limited).
	- When writing to a file, the output method now returns the pathname
	- The %%BoundingBox must be integers.  If it's not, round up and
	  also add a %%HiResBoundingBox comment.
	- Fixed bug in pstr (wasn't quoting backslashes)
	- It's %%PageOrder, not %%Order (and the order should be capitalized)
	- Added an examples directory
