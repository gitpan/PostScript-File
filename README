CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 2.10 of PostScript::File:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	API improvements:

	- You can pass "newpage => 0" to the constructor to prevent it
	  from creating the first page.	 This leads to more natural
	  loops, because you call newpage before each page (instead of
	  "before each page except the first").
	- Added get_printable_width, get_printable_height,
	  get_page_printable_width, & get_page_printable_height methods

	- Fixed bug: clipping never actually worked
	- Fixed bug: errx parameter was not handled correctly in new
	- Documentation fixes
