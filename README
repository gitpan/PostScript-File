PostScript::File version 2.00, released February 26, 2010

This module produces the outline for an Adobe PostScript file. It provides
convenient routines for writing postscript directly, including reporting
postscript errors and debugging support.  Although it may be used independently,
the functions provided are also suitable for use in other modules.  See one of
these modules for a top-level object.

    PostScript::Calendar
    PostScript::Report
    PostScript::Graph::XY
    PostScript::Graph::Bar
    Finance::Shares::Chart

It is considered beta code as the interface has remained stable over many months
of use.  However, not all the features have been tested properly so experiment
with caution.



INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install



DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries, although they are both
part of the standard distribution:

  File::Spec
  Sys::Hostname



CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 2.00 of PostScript::File:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	- Numerous API changes, mostly minor, but there could be
	  problems with backwards compatibility.

	- Changed ISOLatin1Encoding to match PostScript's
	  The HYPHEN-MINUS (\x2D) is now /minus instead of /hyphen.
	  Use SOFT-HYPHEN (\xAD) to get a proper hyphen.
	  Made the same change to Win1252Encoding (cp1252).

	  Please read Hyphens and Minus Signs in PostScript::File for details.

	- Added auto_hyphen attribute with get/set methods
	- Added need_fonts attribute
	- Added as_string, embed_font, need_resource, & testable_output methods
	- add_resource accepts all DSC 3.0 resource types,
	  but no longer accepts generic 'Resource' type
	- Reencode fonts added using embed_font or add_resource
	- Added PostScript::File::Metrics, which includes the metrics
	  for the standard PostScript fonts.  No more trying to
	  configure Font::AFM!!!
	- PNG output has been removed.  Use PostScript::Convert instead.
	- embed_document now handles & removes TIFF, WMF, or EPSI preview
	- output accepts an open filehandle as a filename alternative
	- Passing undef to output always returns the PostScript as a string

	Minor changes in 2.00:

	- Don't reencode Symbol; it doesn't use the StandardEncoding.
	  This is not backwards compatible, but I doubt anyone was
	  using Symbol-iso, as it's not very useful.
	- Mapped some control characters as accents in Win1252Encoding,
	  since the Red Book suggests they are required in langlevel 1
	- add_default, add_resource, add_setup, add_page_setup,
	  add_page_trailer, & add_trailer now append instead of
	  overwriting previous value
	- add_function is now a no-op if has_function returns true
	- add_resource uses BeginResource instead of deprecated comments
	- get_strip now returns 'none', 'space', or 'comments'
	  instead of the regular expression being used
	- In eps mode, output now returns a list of pages
	- Multiple calls to output no longer cause duplicate resources
	- Passing a filename to output does not permanently set the filename
	- Fonts & resources appear in the document Setup section
	  instead of the Prolog
	- Include a Local Variables section for Emacs in the %%Trailer
	  describing the file's encoding
