PostScript::File version 2.20, released February 11, 2012

This module produces the outline for an Adobe PostScript file. It provides
convenient routines for writing PostScript directly, including reporting
PostScript errors and debugging support.  Although it may be used independently,
the functions provided are also suitable for use in other modules.  See one of

CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 2.20 of PostScript::File:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	API improvements:

	- Added use_functions method, which selects functions from a
	  library provided by new module PostScript::File::Functions.
	- Added set_min_langlevel method
	- Added all_comments strip type
	- Renamed methods add_function, get_functions, & has_function
	  to add_procset, get_procsets, & has_procset.	The old names
	  are still available for backwards compatibility, but their
	  use is deprecated.

	- Multi-line string literals are now protected from
	  comment/whitespace stripping.
	- Fixed bug: add_preview might strip the preview
	- Fixed bug: check_tilde treated "0" like the empty string
	- Private methods bbox_comment, pre_pages, post_pages, &
	  print_file were renamed.  You shouldn't have been using them
	  anyway.
	- The get_ordinal method is now private.  While it was
	  formerly documented, it unnecessarily exposed the internals
	  and had no real use.
	- The documentation has been cleaned up.
